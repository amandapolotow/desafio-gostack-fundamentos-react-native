<h2>Introduction</h1>

<p>This app was built as an exercise to practice the use of AsyncStorage in React Native. 
It is part of an online marketplace, more specifically, the shopping cart, where you can 
add products and store the information in the user's phone. Even when you turn off the app,
the information will still be there when you go back, similarly to what happens with LocalStorage
on the browser.</p>
<p> Since it is an exercise, it uses JSON Server as a fake API. 
It serves data through an URL using a JSON file.</p> 

<h2>Technologies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>React Native</li>
  <li>Typescript (adds type to Javascript)</li>
  <li>Axios (API consumption)</li>

  <li>Styled-Components (manags CSS)</li>
  <li>JSON-Server (mocks an API)</li>
</ul>
